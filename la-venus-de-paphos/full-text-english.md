The student of human nature cannot with impunity neglect researches into antiquity. To obtain just notions of society as it now exists, we must trace it from its feeble beginnings, to its greatest known development, watch its increase, its modifications, its vicissitudes, and learn exactly to appreciate every successive form through which it has paseed. It is unquestionably an easy matter to affect a disdain for the wanderings of man's intellect, before the light of truth burst in upon it. But this contempt, even were it real and well-founded, will not satisfy the mind. It is more agreeable to understand than to despise our forefathers; and therefore, researches into their opinions, particularly such as regarded their religion and philosophy, possess peculiar attractions for every individual above a mere newspaper or novel reader.

Before we enter upon any examination of the dissertation of Monsieur Guigniaut, it may, perhaps, be useful to trace from other sources, a rapid sketch of the history of the worship of beauty, which, according to the best authorities, sprung up together with most other forms of superstition, in the East, and gradually found its way into Greece, where it attained a perfection and consistency unknown to its original inventors. About the middle of the last century, the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, of Paris, proposed as the subject of a prize essay, "An inquiry concerning the various names and attributes of Venus, among the different nations of Greece and Italy; the origin and reason of those attributes; the nature of her worship; the celebrated temples, statues, and pictures of this goddess; and the artists who had rendered themselves celebrated by representing her." The essay which obtained the prize, was that of Monsieur Larcher, the well-known translator of Herodotus. With some taste, and immense learning, he amassed almost everything respecting this goddess, to be found in the works of the ancients; and if he did not succeed in composing an agreeable book, his judgment, not his knowledge, was to blame. Hyginus, Apollodorus, and the other ancient mythologists, have left us brief abstracts of the fables concerning Venus; and Tacitus, with that energetic conciseness for which he is remarkable, has given in one page an outline of the whole history of her worship. Before we come to this passage, however, we shall cast a glance over the history of its migration westward through Asia, taking up the thread of the narrative in Assyria.

The earliest notice we find of Venus, is under the name of Mylitta, Mithra, Alitta, etc. By this word, according to the interpretation of Julius Firmicus, the orientals, who represent all the operations of nature allegorically, meant to designate the vivifying power of the universe. Those writers who consider fire the first principle of all things, speak of Venus as the daughter of Cœlus or Ouranos; the Neptunians say she sprang from the foam of the sea; others call her the daughter of Jupiter and Dione. Whatever was her origin, she was from the beginning thought to preside over the union of the sexes; and is spoken of by the mystical Orpheus, as reason is by Lao-tseu, the celebrated Chinese philosopher, as the mother of the universe --- πάντα γὰρ ἐκ σέθεν ἐστὶν, says he, in his hymn to this goddess. Servius also observes to the same effect --- "Dicunt ipsam Venerem esse matrem Deûm." So great and universal was the power of Venus, that she exercised authority even over the fates, the iron goddesses, who resisted all other rule.

From Assyria the worship of Venus passed to Phœnicia, and thence to Cyprus. This worship, which in the course of time degenerated into prostitution, was pure at first, and offered up to Venus Urania, a virgin goddess. Herodotus speaks of a shameful custom which had insinuated itself at Babylon, into the ceremonies of this worship, and afterwards prevailed at Heliopolis of Phœnicia, and at Aphka (Hodie Afka) near Mount Lebanon. Mr. Larcher says that Constantine destroyed the temples, and abolished the infamous custom in the last two cities: but in this he is perfectly mistaken; for, whatever may have been the fate of the temples, the custom still survives, in the midst of other manners, and other creeds. Zosimus, who passes over the practice to which we have alluded, amuses his readers with the fabulous history of a globe of fire or lighted torch, which appeared in the air, in the environs of the temple; and gravely says, that the offerings made to the goddess were thrown into a lake close at hand, and that such as were accepted sunk to the bottom, while those which the divinity of the place refused, floated upon the top.

The remarks of Mr. Larcher on the name Salambo, which according to Hesychius, the Babylonians applied to Venus, are very ingenious. They could not, says he, have made use of this term, since it is a Greek word, derived from σάλα which properly signifies the agitation of the sea, and metaphorically that of the soul. From σάλα is derived σαλαΐζειν, to strike the bosom, as in grief; or to lament the loss of something. Σαλαΐς, groans; σαλάβη, the agitation of the soul. According to the author of the Etymologicum Magnum, Σαλάμβας was a goddess thus named, because she wandered about, weeping for Adonis. Anacreon uses the word σαλαΐζειν in the sense of, "to weep," "to deplore;" for grief and trouble agitate and disturb the soul. Thus, Salambo, signifies Venus lamenting the death of Adonis. Selden supposes Delephat, and the Syrian goddess, to have been identical with Venus. Strabo says she was called Atargatis; and Eratosthenes gives her the name of Derceto.

This Venus, in fact, was known under many different names. According to Cicero, in his work on the Nature of the Gods, she was called Astarte in Syria. It was to this goddess that the Emperor Helagabalus married the new god, which under his own name he had added to the Roman Pantheon. Astarte, who is represented by the Pagans as the wife of Adonis, was worshipped with peculiar honours at Byblos: I have seen, says Lucian, at Byblos, a vast temple dedicated to Venus, in which the orgies of Adonis are celebrated. I have examined these orgies; for pretending that Adonis was killed in their country by the boar, they every year strike themselves in commemoration of this event; they give way to lamentations, perform the prescribed rites, and an air of mourning pervades the whole country. When their weeping and self-tormenting cease, sacrifices, such as are performed in honour of the dead, are offered to Adonis. On the following day he is supposed to return to life, his statue is exposed in the open air, and his worshippers shave their heads, as the Egyptians do at the death of Apis.

This festival was observed in nearly all the countries of the East, to perpetuate, according to the mythologists, the remembrance of the loves of Venus and Adonis. The physical interpretation of this fable we leave to others, persuaded that whatever meaning we might attribute to it, a hundred other interpretations equally probable might be discovered. We shall merely observe that a statue of this goddess, supposed to represent the earth when stripped of its beauty by winter, was found on Mount Libanus, with the left hand enveloped in the drapery, the head covered, the countenance sad; and it was even supposed by some, that tears were represented trickling from the eyes.

Shakespeare, who penetrated with philosophical acuteness into the depths of ancient fable, and breathed a new life into worn-out legends, has entered with his accustomed truth to nature, into the spirit of this magnificent fable. The goddess is represented wandering about the mountains, dejected, apprehensive, sorrowful for the absence of Adonis. She commences her search with the dawn.

'Lo! here the gentle lark, weary of rest,  
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,  
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast  
The sun ariseth in his majesty:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Who doth the world so gloriously behold,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.'

'_Venus_ salutes him with this fair good-morrow:  
O thou clear God, and patron of all light!  
From whom each Lamp and shining Star doth borrow  
The beauteous influence, that makes him bright:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There lives a son, that suck'd an earthly mother,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'

'This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,  
Musing the morning is so much o'er-worn;  
And yet she hears no tidings of her love:  
She hearkens for his hounds, and for his horn;  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anon she hears them chaunt it lustily,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.' --- p. 85.

Proceeding some little distance, she discovers, by the fierce and eager baying of the hounds, that her lover is engaged in no gentle sport, but attacking the boar, the bear, or the lion. Sad forebodings now throng on her heart. She trembles, and remains rooted to the spot. Anon she sees the tremendous boar dashing by, his snout covered with foam and blood, and bearing all the marks of having been engaged in a fierce struggle.

'And with that word, she spy'd the hunted boar,  
Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,  
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,  
A second fear thro' all her sinews spread,  
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither.' --- p. 86.

Her terrors now increasing every moment, are presently after enhanced by perceiving the wounded and discomfited hounds roaming about without their master. Anticipating the worst --- 

'As faulcon to the lure, away she flies:  
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,  
And in her haste unfortunately spies  
The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Which seen her eyes, as murder'd with the view,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Like stars asham'd of day, themselves withdrew.'

'Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,  
Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,  
And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,  
Long after fearing to creep forth again:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So, at his bloody view her eyes are fled  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Into the deep dark cabins of her head.'

'Where they resign'd their office and their light  
To the disposing of her troubled brain:  
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,  
And never wound the heart with looks again:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Who like a king perplexed in his throne,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By their suggestions gives a deadly groan.'

'Whereat each tributary subject quakes,  
As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,  
Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,  
Which with cold terrors doth men's minds confound.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This mutiny each part doth so surprise,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That from their dark beds, once more, leap her eyes.'

'And, being open'd, threw unwilling sight  
Upon the wide wound, that the boar had trench'd  
In his soft flank; whose wonted lilly white  
With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But stole his blood, and seem'd with him to bleed.'

'This solemn sympathy poor _Venus_ noteth,  
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head:  
Dumbly she passions, frantickly she doteth;  
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Her voice is stopp'd, her joints forget to bow,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes are mad, that they have wept till now.'

'Upon his hurt she looks so stedfastly,  
That her sight dazzling, makes the wound seem three;  
And then she reprehends her mangling eye,  
That makes more gashes where no breach should be;  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.'

'My tongue cannot express my grief for one;  
And yet (quoth she) behold two _Adons_ dead!  
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,  
Mine eyes are turned to fire, my heart to lead:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes as fire,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So shall I die by drops of hot desire.'

'Alas! poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!  
What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?  
Whose tongue is musick now? what canst thou boast  
Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But true sweet beauty liv'd and dy'd in him.'

'Bonnet, or veil, henceforth no creature wear;  
Nor sun, nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:  
Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;  
The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But when _Adonis_ liv'd, sun and sharp air  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.'

'And therefore wou'd he put his bonnet on,  
Under whose brim the gaudy sun wou'd peep;  
The wind wou'd blow it off, and being gone,  
Play with his locks, then wou'd _Adonis_ weep:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And straight, in pity of his tender years,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They both wou'd strive who first shou'd dry his tears.'

'To see his face, the lion walks along  
Behind some hedge, because he wou'd not fear him;  
To recreate himself when he hath sung,  
The tyger wou'd be tame, and gently hear him:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If he had spoke, the wolf wou'd leave his prey,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And never fright the silly lamb that day.'

'When he beheld his shadow in a brook,  
There fishes spread on it their golden gills:  
When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,  
That some would sing, some other in their bills  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Would bring him mulberries, and ripe red cherries;  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.'

The goddess continues her lamentation; and with a conceit not altogether in keeping with the spirit of Greek poetry, imagines the wild beast to have become enamoured of the beautiful form of Adonis, and to have rushed upon him to kiss him. Pursuing this idea she says:---

' 'Tis true, true, true, thus was _Adonis_ slain,  
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,  
Who wou'd not whet his teeth at him again,  
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And nousling in his flank, the loving swine  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sheath'd unaware his tusk in his soft groin.'

'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,  
With kissing him, I shou'd have kill'd him first.  
But he is dead, and never did he bless  
My mouth with his; the more am I accurs'd.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With this she falleth in the place she stood,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And stains her face with his congealed blood.'

'She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;  
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;  
She whispers in his ear a heavy tale,  
As if he heard the woful words she told:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Where, lo! two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.'

'Two glasses, where herself herself beheld  
A thousand times, and now no more reflect;  
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excel'd,  
And every beauty rob'd of his effect.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wonder of time! (quoth she) this is my spight,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That, you being dead, the day shou'd yet be light.'

'Since thou art dead, lo! here I prophesy  
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend;  
It shall be waited on with jealousy,  
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ne'er settled equally to high or low;  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That all love's pleasures shall not match his woe.'

'It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,  
And shall be blasted in a breathing while,  
The bottom poison, and the top o'er-straw'd  
With sweets, that shall the sharpest sight beguile.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The strongest body shall it make most weak,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.'

'It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,  
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;  
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,  
Pluck down the rich, inrich the poor with treasures;  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Make the young old, the old become a child.'

'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;  
It shall not fear, where it should most mistrust;  
It shall be merciful and too severe,  
And most deceiving when it seems most just:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Perverse, it shall be when it seems most toward,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.'

'It shall be cause of war and dire events,  
And set dissention 'twixt the son and sire;  
Subject and servile to all discontents,  
As dry combustious matter is to fire.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sith, in his prime, death doth my love destroy,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They that love best their love shall not enjoy.'

'By this the boy that by her side lay kill'd,  
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,  
And in his blood, that on the ground lay spill'd,  
A purple flower sprung up chequer'd with white,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.'

'She bows her head the new-sprung flower to smell,  
Comparing it to her _Adonis_' breath:  
And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,  
Since he himself is reft from her by death:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.'

'Poor flower! (quoth she) this was thy father's guise,  
(Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire)  
For every little grief to wet his eyes,  
To grow unto himself was his desire,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And so 'tis thine; but know it is as good  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To wither in my breast, as in his blood.'

'Here was thy father's bed, here is my breast,  
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:  
Lo! in this hollow cradle take thy rest,  
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There shall not be one minute of an hour,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'

'Thus weary of the world, away she hies,  
And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid,  
Their mistress mounted, thro' the empty skies  
In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Means to immure herself, and not be seen.' --- pp. 90—94.

To return, however, from this digression. We now come to the introduction of the worship of this goddess into Cyprus, the history of which is thus given by Tacitus. According to the most ancient tradition, a certain king called Aërias, was the founder of the temple of Venus at Paphos. Some, however, pretend, that Aërias was an appellation of the goddess herself. According to a more modern opinion, the temple was consecrated by Cinyras, on the very spot where Venus first landed when she sprang from the sea. It is added that the science of the Haruspices and all the secrets of their art, were brought hither from foreign countries, by Tamiras, the Cilician, and that it was decreed that the descendants of these two families should prescribe in concert over every thing that related to public worship. In a short time, however, in order that the royal family might in all respects be superior to the foreign race, the strangers renounced the science which they had introduced, and from that time forward, the priest consulted has always been a descendant of Cinyras. The male of all kinds of animals is offered up as a victim to the goddess; but in looking into the future, the entrails of goats are always preferred. It is prohibited to stain the altars with blood; prayers and a pure flame alone are offered upon them, and these altars, although in the open air, are never moistened by rain. The goddess is not represented under the human form; the image is a circular block of stone, which, rising in the form of a cone, diminishes gradually from the base to the summit. The reason of this form is unknown.

In his learned and curious dissertation, or _Excursus_, as he terms it, on this passage, Mr. Guigniaut confirms an opinion which we had previously entertained, respecting this ancient statue. He supposes it to be the symbol adored in Hindoostan, by the worshippers of Siva; but, in this instance, joined with the corresponding symbol, which, though admitted into the apparatus of several ancient religions, has always been covered by a thicker veil. He observes, that the Greeks, who were much addicted to borrowing foreign mythi, or fables, and mixing them with their national legends, had, in the worship of Venus, adhered more closely than usual to their own traditions. Cinyras, the founder of the temple, and a descendant in the sixth degree from Cephalus and Aurora, was the grandson of Cecrops, first king of Attica. From this tradition, it is inferred that Paphos, as well as several other cities of Cyprus, was founded by Athenian colonists, after the siege of Troy. A portion of the population of Cyprus, according to Herodotus, was of African origin, having come into the island from Ethiopia, or more probably from Egypt. Mr. Creuzer, indeed, discovers an Egyptian in Aërias, and observes, that the ancient name of this country, about which so much uncertainty, and so many fables prevail, was Aëria. Mr. Guigniaut, however, with whom, on this occasion, we are much more disposed to agree, thinks that the name of Aërias, or Aëria, attributed by many to the goddess herself, has a natural affinity with that of _Aous_,* first king of the country, who is, in fact, no other than Tithon, or Phaeton, and means, _child of Aurora_. Possibly, also, Cinyras and Adonis may be only one and the same person under different names; in which case, we should have here a striking example of a phenomenon by no means rare in the religions of antiquity, in which the God, the object of adoration, is also represented as the institutor of his own worship, as the first king and the first priest. In the first place, Adonis reigned in Cyprus, as well as Cinyras. The latter, on the other hand, was a native of Byblos, in Phœnicia, a city renowned for the worship of Adonis, or Thammuz, a deity purely Phœnician: he had erected a temple to Venus on mount Libanus, and, pursuing the genealogical thread with which we are now engaged, Adonis was his son, by a daughter of Pygmalion, king of Phœnicia. Now, the name of the latter was Gingras, the name also of a peculiar kind of flute used in Phœnicia to express mourning; and the name of Cinyras, which is not at all unlike that of Gingras, while it expressed tears and mourning, was also applied to an instrument of music. Let us add, that Adonis, the unfortunate lover of Venus, was known at Lacedemon under the name of Ciris, or Cyris, an appellation which might be derived from κυριος and would in that case be merely a translation of the Phœnician Adonai, or Lord. It may be added, that Cinyras and his descendants were said to be buried in the temple at Paphos, and that Venus herself was also interred in the same spot, beside her lover, evidently confounded with Adonis. Milton, who had looked with a curious eye into the fables of antiquity, represents Astarte as the moon, in the following beautiful passage --- 

" --- With those in troop  
Came Ashtoreth, whom the Phœnicians called  
Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with crescent horns:  
To whose bright image nightly by the moon,  
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs,  
In Sion also not unsury, where stood  
Her temple on the offensive mountain, built,  
By that uxorious King, whose heart tho' large,  
Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell  
To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,  
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured  
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate,  
In amorous ditties all a summer's day.  
While smooth Adonis from his native rock,  
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood  
Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale  
Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,  
Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch  
Ezekiel saw, when by the vision led  
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries  
Of alienated Judah."

*) Aous was also a river of Chaonia. Palmer à Grentemenil. Ant. Græc. Descrip. p. 144.

We here discover, says Mr. Guigniaut, through the mists of Grecian fable, the real origin and character of the Paphian worship. It was an Asiatic and Phœnician worship, in which sadness was mingled with pleasure, as we may infer from the very names of Cinyras and Adonis, which lead us to believe that at some very early period, Cyprus was colonized by the Phœnicians. It was they who built the ancient Golgi, a name which bears evident marks of its Phœnician origin; who instituted both here and at the ancient Paphos, the worship of Venus Urania, long before the Arcadian Agapenor, on his return from Troy, had built the new city, and adorned it with superb temples. In proof of the justness of Milton's views on this subject, the most learned mythologists of our own days, represent Venus as the great goddess of nature, generally identified with the moon, but occasionally, in the opinion of Mr. Guigniaut, with the planet Venus, the morning star, Aurora.

From Cyprus, or Cythera, the worship of Venus passed into the 
Peloponnesus and the other parts of Greece, where it was soon con- 
founded with that of the ancient national goddess, Aphrodite. This 
is the ordinary way of tracing the history of this worship, But if 
the Greeks had already an Aphrodite, a goddess embodying the 
“erga of beauty, and presiding over the empire of love, where- 

ore borrow the Astarte of the Orientals, and mingle up a coarser 
and more material fable with their own exquisite legend? We 
cannot, for our part, discover the grounds upon which mythologists 
build up this specious theory, and are rather disposed to believe 
that although the Greeks may have naturalized some of the fables 
of the Orientals, the original type of the goddess existed among 
them previous to all communication with the East. Before we 
pass, however, from Cyprus to the continent, we will present the 
reader with ashort description of the temple of Venus, at Cyprus :— 

—‘* With speed the two iinmortals came 
To the grand mansion of the Cyprian dame, 
Which crippled Vulcan raised, when first he led 
The Paphian goddess to his nuptial bed. 
The gate they pass, and to the dome retire, 
Where Venus oft regales the god of fire: 
He to his forge had gone at early day, 
A floating isle contained it on the bay, 
Here wond’rous works by fire’s fierce power he wrought, 
And on his anvil to perfection brought. 
Fronting the door, all lovely and alone, 
Sat Cythera on a polished throne. 
Adown the shoulders of the heavenly fair 
In easy ringlets flowed her yellow hair; 
And with a golden comb, in matchless grace, 
She taught each lock its most becoming place.” 

Being thus introduced to the goddess and her dwelling hy one 
poet, Apollonius Rhodius, we shall proceed to borrow from another 
an account of the site and appearance of this palace. It was si- 
tuated, says Claudian, on the eastern side of the island, on a lofty 
mountain, inaccessible to men. The rigour of winter, the burning 
heats of summer, are never felt upon this mountain; the winds fear 
to approach it ; and a perpetual spring prevails there. A spacious 
plain occupies the summit, and is enclosed by a wall of gold, which 
prohibits the entrance of mortals. Flowers of eternal beauty 
sprin 2 Mer gent and their exquisite scents are carried hither 
it 
and thither by the rm yrs. Ina dark wood, which stands on one 
= of the plain, birds of the most lovely notes sing perpetually. 
ven the very trees are here capable of love, and entertain and are 
the objects of tender sentiments. The palm tree bends oyer its be- 
loved; poplar sighs for pone plane for plane; and a soft murmur 
pervades the wood. ‘Two fountains flow from this spot: the one 
sweet, the other so bitter that even honey is rendered disagreeable 
when mingled with its waters. In these fountains Cupid, it is said, 
dips his arrows. A thousand little loves, with their quivers on their 
shoulders, sport upon the banks. These little deities are all bre- 
thren, and resemble each other. They are the children of the 
nymphs. Cupid alone is the son of Venus. It is he, who, with 
his bow in his hand, rules over both heaven and earth ; it is he 
who wounds princes with his arrows, while the other Loves shoot their 
darts at inferior persons. In those lovely regions reign liberty, the 
placable anger of lovers, vigils steeped in wine, tears unshed, the 
sweet paleness of lovers, their timid boldness, agreeable fears, and 
insecure pleasures. Broken vows flit about upon their light wings, 
and proud, self-confiding youth forbids age to enter the grove. The 
palace of the goddess reflects the rays of the sun in a thousand 
ways; itis constructed of gold and jewels with the greatest art ; 
its beams are of emerald, its pillars of jacinth, its walls of beryl, 

its threshold of jasper, and its floors of agate. The a is 
filled with all the perfumes of Arabia. The Graces stand at the 
side of the goddess, and while one of them pours out the nectar, 
the other two adjust her ringlets in an easy negligent manner, which 
enchants the eye. 

Entering the Peloponnesus we find at Lacedemon, a round 
temple dedicated to Olympian Jupiter and Venus. Another temple 
in the same city was sacred to the worship of Venus-Juno. At 
Megalopolis, in Arcadia, at Tegea, at Olympia, were temples de- 
dicated to this goddess; and at Elis, near the forum, and behind 
the portico erected from the spoils of the Corcyreans, there was 
also a temple of Venus, with a small estate belonging to it. The 
statue of the goddess, formed of gold and ivory by Phidias, stood 
with one foot upon a tortoise, to signify, says Plutarch, that married 
women should remain at home and be silent. At Sicyon the wor- 
ship of Venus was conducted in a very extraordinary manner. To 
cast a kind of mystery around the rites, no person was permitted to 
enter the temple but the sacristan and priestess, who, while they offi- 
ciated in the temple, were compelled to lead a life of rigid chastity. 
The worshippers were constrained to kneel on the threshold of the 
temple, and from thence offer their vows to the unseen deity within. 
A very learned writer supposes that this custom was derived from 
Egypt, where, from the melancholy character of the people, it was 
thought that fasting and abstaining even from lawftl pleasures 
were agreeable to heaven. 

Venus had several templesat Athens. In the quarterof the city 
called ‘‘ the gardens,” there was a temple, near which the goddess 
was represented by a quadrangular stone, with an inscription en- 
graven upon it, in which Venus was said to be more ancient than 
the Fates. Above the Ceramicus was another temple to Venus, 
containing a statue from the hand of Phidias. One of the 
temples of this goddess was dedicated to her under the name 
of Venus Psithyros, or the whisperer, because the women who 
addressed their vows to her, whispered in the ear of the statue. 
Upon this practice Seneca remarks,—* Turpissima vota diis insus- 
urrunt,si quis ad moverit auem, conticescent, et quod scire hominem 
nolunt, des narrant.” One of the three parts of the Pirzeus was 
called Aphrodisium, and probably derived its name from the 
temple erected there by Conon, in memory of the victory ob- 
tained over the Lacedemonians, near Cnidos in Caria. ’ 

The epithets of this goddess were numerous and significant ; but 
we shall abstain from repeating them. From her temple, however, 
on mount Eryx in Sicily, she obtained the epithet Erycina, which 
occurs constantly in the works of the ancient poets. Mount 
Eryx is near the sea, between Drepanum and Panormus, in that 
part of Sicily which faces Italy. Upon the summit of this moun- 
tain, which is exceedingly steep, on the the side of Drepanum, 
and, next to Etna, the highest in the whole island, was a small 

plain, which, according to tradition, was artificially enlarged, by 
edalus. Upon this plain stood the famous temple of Venus, 
overlooking the city of Drepanum, which was built on the slope 
of the mountain, where Trapani del Monte now stands. This 
temple was scarcely less rich than that of Paphos; and among 
its curiosities, which consisted of antique phials, crateras, censers, 
&c., was a honey-comb in gold, said to be the work of Dedalus. 
Diodorus of Sicily, who enlarges with complacency upon this 
great ornament of his native country, remarks, that no person 
could fail to admire the glory of this temple. Other fanes, says 
he, have acquired celebrity, but the revolutions of time have 
humbled or destroyed them. This temple alone, founded in the 
remotest antiquity, has gone on increasing in consideration 
to the present day. To say nothing of the devotion of Eryx, 
(a king who, according to some tradition, was founder of the 
temple), AZneas, landing in Sicily, on his way to Italy, adorned 
this temple with a number of offerings. The Sicanians continued 
to pay divine honours to the goddess during many generations, and 
perpetually adorned her temple with magnificent presents. When 
the Carthaginians made themselves masters of the island, they 
treated the goddess with particular marks of respect; and, to 
conclude, the Romans, having added Sicily to their empire, sur- 
passed all their predecessors, in their veneration of the deity of 
this temple. This, however, was to be expected; for since they 
pretended to derive their origin from Venus, and had filled their 
city with temples, erected to her, to whom they thought their 
success in wars and peace was to be attributed, it was natural 
they should honour her temples, wherever they might be found. 
The consuls, the pretors, in one word, all the magistrates who 
come into this island, offer magnificent sacrifices, and pay extra- 
ordinary honours to the goddess; and as soon as they arrive at 
mount Eryx, lay aside all the insignia of power, in order to amuse 
themselves gaily and at their ease, with their mistresses, that they 
may thus render the goddess propitious. The Roman senate, 
with singular piety, have issued a decree, authorizing seventeen of 
the most faithful cities in Sicily, to wear gold in honour of tie 
goddess, and to guard her temple with two hundred soldiers. 

Both the inhabitants and strangers daily offered sacrifices to 
Venus, on the great altar of the temple, which was constructed in 
the open air. ‘These sacrifices generally occupied the worshippers 
from morning until night, and must have produced large heaps of 
cinders, charcoal, &c., but Elian, with true Pagan credulity, 
informs us that nothing of all these was visible next morning, 
but that a heavy dew was upon the ground, and fresh grass which 
had sprang up during the night. To render matters still more 
astonishing, he adds that no force was necessary to bring the 
victims to the altar, but that the animals, pleased to be sacrificed
